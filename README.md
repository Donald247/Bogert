# Bogert
Playing around with some chess AI!

# TODO:

- Order the possible moves such that takes are searched first, should increase the amount of pruning
- Add some form of end game table - currently it has no mate sense
- Add in an opening play book, can get stuck running knights around the board at the start!
- Export games as PGNs so they can be evaluated on lichess.com
